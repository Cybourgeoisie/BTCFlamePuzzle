Shakespeare

	"It's a poem that some people think is about Queen Elizabeth I and John Salusbury, whom Queen Elizabeth knighted for helping suppress some sort of a rebellion."

"Greek Keys" - the corner borders

"Hi guys. I ran the final clue image through stegdetect and it seems to think there's a jphide message hidden in there. Haven't been able to stegbreak it though."
"Uploaded the original image to fotoforensics.com,  seems OK nothing hidden there."

the name: OSpEZtA - "I don't think OSpEZtA is relevant to the puzzle. It's automatically generated by Imgur and can't be customized."

colors - RGBY

"Take a look at @Coin_Artist's Twitter account - more hints that the solution is steganographic in nature. I think the Baconian Cipher is still our best bet given all the references to Shakespeare throughout this step of the puzzle."

"Several people mentioned it, but it often gets forgotten here: The money is in the 1FLAMEN6rq2BqMnkUmsJBqCGWdwgVKcegd address. That "FLAME" at the beginning certainly is not random, which means that it is generated using some vanity address generator, which again means that the private key which corresponds to this address is totally random, completely uncontrollable by the creator of the puzzle. There's 0 chance some meaningfully, readable text or something like that is brainwallet which is needed to solve the puzzle, there is no brainwallet and the solution we are looking for is either:
- private key in WIF format, or some other encoding like QR code
- some specific number that obviously pops out and is used as secret exponent"

" just have a look at the tweets to @coin_artist and her retweets. i have some ideas, but am still figuring out how to link all the infos i ve gained together."

"Did you try 6 combinations? She retweeted Bither which shows how to generate a key using dice which is base6 I believe."
99 characters in base6?

"Ok cool, I wasn't sure if this was part of that whole white rabbit puzzle etc or something new and entirely different. She also mentioned the Baconian cypher too so I think we are looking for possible shapes as well. I notice the shape of the letter V appears on the drawing alot, like in upper right corner in black, perhaps the letter V is one symbol and another shape that repeats throughout the image is another symbol, though I haven't found one yet"

"But 456 bits is much more than is needed for a private key.  You need either:
 1) 256 bits for a raw key; or
 2) 296 bits for a wallet import formatted key (uncompressed); or
 3) 304 bits for a wallet import formatted key (compressed)"
