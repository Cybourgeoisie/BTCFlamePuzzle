The key is encrypted by the physical artwork

It's also ciphered.

The cipherkey is also in the artwork


So my point is- even if you find a string, do not discount it, if it doesn't begin with a "1"

Filename doesn't matter



Here's the backstory to this piece

I was in the middle of completing the amazing TLSN series, when my life literally imploded. I was rekt for about a year and everything stalled. Including the puzzle series. I made this piece as a promise to myself to get back on my feet and to give a conclusion to something amazing I had been building. So that I could move forward. All the poetic references in this piece are relevant to that time in my life.
